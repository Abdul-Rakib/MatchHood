# NeighborFit 🏘️ – Smart Neighborhood Matching Engine

**NeighborFit** is a full-stack web application designed to help users find neighborhoods that best match their lifestyle preferences. Built with a focus on data analysis, real-world constraints, and algorithmic decision-making, NeighborFit bridges the gap between people and places using research-backed insights and intelligent matching.

## 🧪 Problem Analysis & Research

### 🔍 Research Approach
- Analyzed existing neighborhood-matching platforms for strengths and limitations.
- Due to restricted access to public APIs, we scraped structured data from publicly available real estate listings to gather insights on neighborhoods, including rental trends, property types, and locality descriptions.
- Identified gaps: lack of lifestyle-oriented filtering, no personalization beyond affordability or commute.

### 📐 Hypothesis
> "People choose neighborhoods based on a combination of affordability, vibe, safety, and proximity — not just one factor."

### 📊 Data Collection
- Public APIs and open datasets (e.g., Census, crime data, location reviews)
- User survey data (demographics, preferences)
- Scraped or manually collected neighborhood information where APIs were limited

## 🧠 Technical Implementation

### 🧮 Matching Algorithm
- Weighted scoring system with configurable parameters
- Factors: Safety, Commute, Affordability, Lifestyle Tags, Amenities
- Users input preferences; algorithm ranks neighborhoods

### 🏗️ Architecture
- **Frontend**: React.js + Tailwind CSS  
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express.js  
- **Database**: MongoDB (NoSQL, schema-flexible for dynamic user data)  
- **Deployment**: AWS (Frontend), AWS (Backend API), S3 (Media Files)
